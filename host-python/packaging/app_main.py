"""app_main.py — the bundled entry for the double-click DreamLayer Brain app.

One entry, two shells: bundled by ``host-python/packaging/setup_app.py``
(py2app → the macOS menu-bar app) and by
``host-python/packaging/windows/DreamLayer.spec`` (PyInstaller → the Windows
system-tray app). A single process that:
  1. starts the Brain HTTP server on a background daemon thread, then
  2. runs the platform appliance UI on the main thread (rumps menu bar on
     macOS, pystray tray on Windows — each must own main).

State lives in ``~/.dreamlayer`` exactly like ``python -m dreamlayer.ai_brain.server``
— the bundle ships no user data and writes nothing inside itself, so it works
read-only from /Applications or Program Files. On first run it mints a pairing
token if none is set.

Extra Windows-only entry modes (dispatched before the server starts):
  --panel-window <url>   run the native WebView2 panel window (the tray
                         re-invokes the exe with this; see
                         ai_brain/webview_window_windows.py)
  --smoke                start the server, wait until it answers, exit 0 —
                         the CI smoke launch (works on every platform)
