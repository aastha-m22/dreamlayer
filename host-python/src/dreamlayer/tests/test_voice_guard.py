"""voice_guard — never voiceprint a stranger (B4).

person_guard refuses to identify a stranger's face; voice_guard is its twin for
speaker biometrics. The capture pipeline used to compute AND retain an ECAPA
voiceprint for EVERY speech segment — including bystanders who never consented
(refute 2026-07-18: `last_speaker_embedding = emb` ran unconditionally, even with
no resolver to ever use it). These pin the new rule: a voiceprint is retained only
for an ENROLLED speaker; a stranger's is discarded, and when identification is
impossible none is computed at all.
