"""test_server_http_hardening.py — the Brain HTTP server's request surface.

Regression suite for the HTTP-surface hardening (audit 2026-07-17, "HTTP surface
robustness" B-→A). Every test below is *revert-failing*: undo the matching fix in
ai_brain/server/server.py and the assertion breaks. The five closed gaps:

  1. NO request-body size cap — _body()/_raw() read Content-Length bytes
     unconditionally and _write_upload wrote the raw body with no cap, so an
     authed/loopback caller could drive unbounded memory or fill the disk.
     Fix: a bounded read with a 16 MiB JSON cap (MAX_JSON_BODY) and a 64 MiB
     upload cap (MAX_UPLOAD_BODY); oversize → 413, refused *before* the body is
     read (a declared-oversize Content-Length allocates nothing).
  2. Malformed Content-Length — int(header) raised an unhandled ValueError deep
     in _body(), surfacing as a 500/torn connection. Fix: guarded → 400.
  3. NO socket timeout (slowloris) — a slow client pinned a worker thread
     forever. Fix: Handler.timeout = SOCKET_TIMEOUT_S applied via setup().
  4. NO thread ceiling — ThreadingHTTPServer spawned one thread per connection
     unbounded (thread-exhaustion DoS). Fix: a BoundedSemaphore of
     MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS acquired in the accept loop, released per worker.
  5. Unsynchronized egress counter — config.cloud_calls += 1 was a non-atomic
     load-add-store with no lock, so two concurrent cloud asks lost a count.
     Fix: bump_cloud_calls() guards the increment with a dedicated Lock.

A later refute pass (audit 2026-07-17) confirmed two gaps the first pass left:

  6. The socket timeout is PER-RECV, not a total-request deadline — a slow-POST
     that dribbles a byte just under it resets the clock forever, pinning a
     worker + a semaphore slot. Fix: MAX_REQUEST_BODY_SECONDS, a wall-clock cap
     on reading the whole body (read in bounded read1 slices against a deadline);
     exceeding it aborts the read → 408 and frees the worker/slot.
  7. A body the server can't length-delimit (Transfer-Encoding present, no
     usable Content-Length) was returned as b"" — silently accepted as empty, so
     /upload wrote a 0-byte file and answered ok. Fix: reject → 411, no artifact.

A later revert (audit 2026-07-18) undid a short-lived split of the read and send
deadlines. A change had raised the socket timeout to a flat SEND_TIMEOUT_S=300 s
on the write path so a slow LARGE-response drain wouldn't be cut at the 30 s read
bound — but that armed a 10x slow-read DoS: a client that triggers a large
response and STOPS READING pins a worker (blocked in sendall(), holding a
semaphore slot) for ~300 s, so ~64 non-reading clients exhaust the pool for that
long. The rationale was self-undercut — the only large responses (/backup,
assets) are _from_localhost()-only and drain sub-second over loopback/LAN, while
remote (phone) endpoints return small JSON — so a single 30 s bound governs both
recv and send. test_no_flat_send_timeout_bump below guards against reintroducing
it.
