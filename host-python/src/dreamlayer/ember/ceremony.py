"""ember/ceremony.py — the deletion ceremony: the machine makes itself
unnecessary, and proves it.

When an engram graduates (scheduler.py raised the flag), its recording
becomes a standing *offer*, never an automatic act: `offers()` lists what may
burn; `burn()` burns exactly one, and only with `consent=True` passed
explicitly by the surface the wearer tapped. There is no burn_all and no
default — the whole feature is an argument about agency, and the ceremony is
where the argument has to be airtight.

What a burn actually does, in order:
  1. purge the source memory through memory.retrieval.Retriever.purge_memory
     — the row AND its ANN vector (a bare db.purge leaves the moment
     recallable by similarity; see the warning in memory/privacy.py),
  2. blank the engram's answer and mark it burned (store.mark_burned),
  3. optionally plant a *tombstone*: a pinned memory holding only the cue,
     so the anniversary Ember lens (ops_world_lenses.ember) can, a year on,
     show "you kept: 'What did Dad say about the ice?'" — and the wearer
     answers it from the only place it still exists.

The receipt returned is the demo, the log line, and the trust artifact: what
burned, when, and what remains.
