"""object_lens/recognizer.py — general object recognition (pluggable).

The hard part of an Object Lens is a vision model that names *arbitrary*
objects, not just faces. That model runs on the Halo NPU in production; here
the recognizer is a clean seam:

    ObjectRecognizer(classify_fn=my_npu_model)   # real quantized classifier
    ObjectRecognizer()                           # deterministic mock

`classify_fn(frame) -> (label, confidence, attributes)`. When absent, a
deterministic mock maps frame statistics onto a small taxonomy so the rest
of the lens — providers, panels, HUD — is fully exercisable and testable
without a model.

Privacy boundary: the recogniser panels a label only if it names something in
the object taxonomy (an allowlist). Any other label — an unknown object, a
person-ish word, an open-vocab description of a human — is declined and left to
the Social Lens. People are its consented domain; the Object Lens is for things.

# indicators, NOT an object allowlist (an allowlist would decline every novel
# object and break the open-vocab object path). The audit's real complaint was
# that the ORIGINAL set was only 6 words, so "boy"/"man in a suit" slipped
# through; the set below is widened to ~30 person indicators (audit 2026-07-15),
