"""object_lens/person_guard.py — layered "never identify a stranger" defence.

Refusing to identify a stranger is the product's hardest privacy rule. The
recognizer already refuses generic person-words and proper-name shapes
(recognizer._names_a_person). This module adds two OPTIONAL, fail-safe layers
that harden the places a VLM can still slip an identity through:

  * TEXT  — Presidio NER on the label catches a personal NAME the shape rule
            can't (a lone given name like "Maya", an odd capitalisation). Uses
            the presidio-analyzer already shipped in the `privacy` extra.
  * VISUAL— a person DETECTOR on the frame (detection, NEVER recognition — we
            only learn THAT a human is the subject, never WHO) defers a frame the
            VLM mislabelled as an object. Uses the `vision` extra's detector.

Both layers are lazy, cached, and wrapped so a missing dependency or ANY error
degrades to a no-op: a layer can only ADD a deferral, never remove one. With
neither dep installed the deterministic recognizer defence stands alone,
unchanged. Detectors are injectable (module-level overrides) so the layering is
unit-tested without the heavy optional deps present.
