"""mDNS discovery (python-zeroconf) — the Mac companion advertises
`_dreamlayer._tcp.local`, the phone finds it automatically (no IP typing).

ADD-alongside: new module. Lazy-imports zeroconf (extras group `infra`); when
absent, advertise()/discover() no-op (returns False / []) so pairing falls back
to the existing manual/QR flow unchanged.
