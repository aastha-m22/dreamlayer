"""plugins/openlibrary.py — a TasteLens connector for books.

Mirrors `plugins/openfoodfacts.py` structure/error-handling/declaration style
(#199): a *shop provider* plugin that scores books by their community rating
from **Open Library** (openlibrary.org/developers/api), a free, keyless
catalog run by the Internet Archive. Look at a bookshelf and TasteLens ranks
each spine by its Open Library rating — same lens, different shelf.

Shape: it registers a `shop_fn(label, attrs) -> {rating, author,
first_publish_year, editions}` through the plugin API. `label` is either a
title or an ISBN — Open Library's search endpoint auto-detects either, so one
query shape covers both (verified against the live API: `q=<isbn>` and
`q=<title>` both resolve through the same `/search.json` doc list). The HTTP
call is a seam (`fetch_fn`) so the logic tests fully offline; the shipped
plugin uses urllib, which is why it declares `requires=("network",)` — same as
Open Food Facts (`add_shop_provider` grants on `shop` OR `network`; declaring
the actual egress channel is what the OFF precedent does).
