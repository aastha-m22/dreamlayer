    HF/transformers/sentence-transformers read HF_HUB_OFFLINE into module-level
    constants AT IMPORT TIME, so setting the flag later (in the Brain's posture
    gate) is too late for a lib already imported (refute 2026-07-18). Doing it here,
    at the very first `import dreamlayer`, guarantees the flag is in the environment
    before those libraries are ever imported, so a wearer who starts the Brain in
    offline mode truly cannot fetch. Runtime incognito toggles are additionally
    handled per-call (e.g. local_files_only in the loaders)."""
