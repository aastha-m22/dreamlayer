"""Render a plugin's HUD card through the *real* on-glass renderer.

This is the SDK's superpower: because DreamLayer runs the exact device render
path in a software rasterizer, an author can see — and snapshot-test — precisely
what their card looks like on the glasses, from a unit test, with no hardware.

    from dreamlayer.sdk import render_card
    img = render_card(my_plugin, {"type": "HelloCard", "text": "hi"})
    img.save("preview.png")            # a PIL image, 256x256, the device output

Use it for visual regression: render, then assert against a committed golden
(pixel-equal or a small tolerance). The renderer + PIL are imported lazily, so
``import dreamlayer.sdk`` stays light for authors who don't preview.
