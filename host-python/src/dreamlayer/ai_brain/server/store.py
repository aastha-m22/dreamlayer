    """Windows only: restrict `path` to the current user + LocalSystem + the
    Administrators group, so no *other regular user* can read it.

    POSIX chmod(0o600) is a no-op for ACLs on Windows — it toggles just the
    read-only attribute and sets NO ACL, so a secret config's confidentiality
    would rest entirely on whatever ACLs it inherited from the user profile.
    This strips inheritance and re-grants Full control to exactly three
    principals:

      * ``S-1-5-18``     LocalSystem     — AV, backup, and OS agents run here;
      * ``S-1-5-32-544`` Administrators  — admin tooling / the elevated installer;
      * the current user's SID           — the app itself.

    Stripping inheritance also drops the inherited SYSTEM/Administrators ACEs,
    so they MUST be re-granted or a plain ``/grant:r *<userSID>:F`` would lock
    out AV/backup/OS-agent readers (and, if the user grant itself failed, the
    app). Confidentiality vs other regular users is still preserved — Users and
    Everyone are gone — while SYSTEM/Administrators (which can read anything on
    the box anyway) keep access. Both well-known SIDs are locale- and
    domain-independent, so this holds regardless of language pack or domain.

    The grantee is the process-token SID, never a bare account name: on a
    domain-joined box a bare ``getpass.getuser()`` name can fail to map once
    inheritance is stripped, leaving the file unreadable by the app — the
    lockout path. So if the SID can't be resolved we do NOT strip inheritance
    behind a possibly-unmappable grant; we skip the whole ACL step and leave the
    file at its inherited-profile baseline (already not world-readable), logging
    a warning. Never leave the file in a state the app can't read.

    Best-effort by contract: any failure is logged and swallowed — the
    POSIX-correct 0o600 already ran, and persisting the privacy posture must
    never crash on ACL plumbing. A hard no-op on non-Windows, so the POSIX save
    path is not touched (returns before importing anything).
