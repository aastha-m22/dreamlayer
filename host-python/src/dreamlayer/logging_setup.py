"""logging_setup.py — opt-in structured logging for the Brain and the hub.

Default behaviour is unchanged (plain human logs). Set ``DL_LOG_JSON=1`` and
every log record becomes one JSON line — timestamp, level, logger, message,
plus any extra fields — so an operator running the Brain as a service (or a CI
run) gets machine-parseable logs without touching call sites.

    from dreamlayer.logging_setup import configure_logging
    configure_logging()          # reads DL_LOG_JSON / DL_LOG_LEVEL from env

Idempotent: safe to call more than once (it replaces its own handler).

# ThreadingHTTPServers here each get their own — and the JSON formatter emits
# it when set. Zero-overhead when unused: the formatter pays one
# ``ContextVar.get()`` and only while emitting a record, and nothing binds an
